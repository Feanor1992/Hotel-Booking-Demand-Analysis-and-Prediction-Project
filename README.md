# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis-and-Prediction-Project
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting hotel booking demand using a dataset from Kaggle. I conducted a comprehensive study, starting with data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) involved identifying key trends in customer bookings, such as seasonality, lead times, and cancellation rates.

Key features were engineered to improve the prediction model, which uses a Random Forest classifier to predict cancellations. I evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.

The project also includes detailed visualizations to present insights, such as the impact of lead time on cancellation probability, and a summary of findings that could help hotels optimize their booking strategies.

### Key Components: ###
